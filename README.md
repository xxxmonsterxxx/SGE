### *Description*
___
**Simple Game Engine (SGE)** is a user-friendly library for game and graphics application development. It simplifies tasks such as:  
âœ” Creating windows  
âœ” Rendering 2D and 3D geometry  
âœ” Loading textures  
âœ” Creating sprite animations  
âœ” Loading .obj models  

Using **SGE**, you can achieve full cross-platform compatibility without dealing directly with **Vulkan, OpenGL, DirectX**, or other low-level APIs.  

ðŸ“Œ To see the engine in action, you can build and run the example project.  

### *How to use?*
___

There is possibility to build library from source code, but other
option is to download release built version as static or shared
[library](https://github.com/xxxmonsterxxx/SGE/releases). It's necessary to download (or include as submodule of git project) and include to your
project follows libraries:    
- [**Simple Graphics Renderer**](https://github.com/xxxmonsterxxx/SGR) (Graphics engine)
- [**GLM**](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) (Math-graphics library)
- [**Vulkan**](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk)
- [**GLFW**](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) (Crossplatform system library)

### ðŸ”§ Integration  
1. Set the path to `SGE/include` in **include directories**  
2. Add `libSGE.*` to your project's **external libraries**  

Manual documentation is currently unavailable. :cry:

### *Environment:*
Currently, there is no automatic script available for setting up the environment.

### *How to build?*
___

- General note:
  To build the project, you will need the appropriate version of the SGR library that matches the version of SGE you are building.

- **Linux / MacOS**
  - To build the project, you need to run the `build.sh` script.
  - Use the `-h` flag to get help on how to use the script.
  - **Debug Mode:**
    - To build the engine in debug mode: `./build.sh -d`
    - To build in debug mode and compile a test project that will automatically run after the build: `./build.sh -de`
  - **Release Mode:**
    - To build the release version: `./build.sh -r`
    - To build and then install the release version: `./build.sh -ri`
  - **Note:** You might need superuser privileges for installation.

- **Windows**
  - The project can also be built on Windows in both debug and release modes.
  - Open the CMake file in Microsoft Visual Studio, which will automatically configure the project settings.
  - You can switch between build modes using the standard methods available in Microsoft Visual Studio.
  

**In result you should to see something like this**

Each build can be **multithreaded**, after `cmake` command will be generated message with max number of your threads.
